# Dont't worry be happy
Project for investigating correlation between the happiness index and the number of sunny days in a year by country

- The World Happiness Report provides information on 147 countries and their respective happiness index scores  - responders are  asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale. 
  This score is determined by several variables that include GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, social support, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and corruption perception.

  Hypothesis 1: 
    Economic prosperity influences happiness more than any other factor

  Hypothesis 2: 
    If it is not just the income that makes people happy, there are also social factors that determine happiness

  Hypothesis 3:
    Happiness can also depend on other factors - like the amount of sunshine
